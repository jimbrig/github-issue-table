# Github Issue Table 

> Personalized issue tracking table built with Flexdashboard to organize and prioritize my assigned Github Issues.

## Details

- Built with flexdashboard R package
- Issues are discovered, pulled in, and parsed using the Github API in conjunction with the `gh` R package.
- Published via githubpages and a github action workflow file to my custom domain at <https://github-issues.jimbrig.com>.

*Issues are split between Users and Organizations using R Markdown Parameters in the YAML Frontmatter*

## User Issues

- Issues assigned to me via my main personal account with username `jimbrig`. These represent my personal development oriented tasks.
- These issues split out *dependabot* created issues versus normal User submitted issues. 

## Organizational Issues

- Issues assigned to me across various organizations. These represent my work/professional project tasks.
